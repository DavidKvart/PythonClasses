    "\n",
    "The transposition cipher is a method of encrypting plaintext by rearranging the positions of its characters without changing the actual characters themselves. In other words, it is a form of encryption that relies on changing the order of characters in a message while keeping the characters themselves unchanged.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The transposition cipher can be implemented in various ways, but the basic idea is to rearrange the characters in a predefined pattern or scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will watch one implementation such implementation in Python. There are, however two differences in comparison to the Ceasar ciphers of previous lab. \n",
    "- The amount of keys possibles are growing with the length of the text\n",
    "- The function to decrypt a transposition cipher is different than the one that encrypts\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why in this lab, we'll only provide you with the encryption function. Can you write a corresponding decryption function that can decipher the secret message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!\n"
