    "# Project 1 - Turtle Library\n",
    "The turtle library in Python is a module that provides a way to create graphics and shapes by controlling a virtual turtle. The turtle is a cursor that can be moved around the screen and used to draw lines and shapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The turtle library provides a simple and fun way for beginners to learn about programming and computer graphics. It is often used in introductory programming courses to teach basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the turtle library, you can create drawings, animations, and even games. The library provides a variety of methods to control the turtle, such as forward, backward, left, right, penup, pendown, and many more. You can also change the color of the turtle, the pen size, and the background color of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the turtle library in Python is a great tool for beginners to learn about programming and computer graphics, and can be a lot of fun to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first coding project we are going to create an advanced turtle application. The goal of the project is to research an extensive library, demonstrate branches, loops and functions and to use additional libraries."

    "- makes use of at least two different control structures (branching, loops, etc.)\n",
    "- makes use of logical data-structures like lists, tuples, set and dictionaries  (For example: you can create list to hold all turtles, or you can use data-structures to hold other application data)\n",
